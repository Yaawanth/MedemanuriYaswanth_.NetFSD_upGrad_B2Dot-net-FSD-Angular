***DAY-4 Hands-On Activities***


**Problem 1: Student Grade Evaluator (Level-1)**

Scenario

A school wants a simple JavaScript program to evaluate a student’s performance 
based on marks obtained in a subject.

 Requirements
• Accept the student’s marks as a variable 
• Use if–else statements to assign grades: 
• Marks ≥ 75 → Grade A 
• Marks ≥ 60 → Grade B 
• Marks ≥ 40 → Grade C 
• Marks < 40 → Fail 
Display the grade on the web page or console 
 
 Technical Constraints
• Use JavaScript variables (let or const)
• Use numeric data types
• Use comparison and logical operators
• No functions or arrays allowed
• Output using console.log() or document.write()

 Learning Outcome
You should be able to:
• Declare and use variables
• Apply comparison operators
• Implement conditional logic using if–else
• Understand decision-making in JavaScript


**Problem 2: Simple Discount Calculator (Level-1)**

Scenario

An online store wants to apply a discount based on the total purchase amount.

 Requirements
• Store purchase amount in a variable
• Apply discount rules:
o Amount ≥ 5000 → 20% discount
o Amount ≥ 3000 → 10% discount
o Amount < 3000 → No discount

• Calculate and display:
o Discount amount
o Final payable amount
 Technical Constraints
• Use arithmetic operators
• Use if–else statements
• Use only primitive data types
No user input (hardcoded values allowed)

 Learning Outcome
You will be able to:
• Perform calculations using operators
• Work with expressions
• Apply conditional statements
• Build real-world logic using JavaScript basics


**Problem 3: Traffic Signal Simulator (Level-2)**

Scenario

A traffic control system needs a JavaScript program that displays instructions based 
on traffic signal color.

 Requirements
• Store signal color in a variable ("red", "yellow", "green")
• Use a switch statement to display:
• Red → Stop
• Yellow → Get Ready
• Green → Go

Handle invalid signal input gracefully
 Technical Constraints
• Must use switch–case
• Use string data types
• Use console.log() for output
• No if–else allowed

 Learning Outcome
Learners should be able to:
• Use switch statements effectively
• Compare string values
• Handle multiple conditions cleanly
• Understand control flow alternatives


**Problem 4: Number Analysis Tool (Level-2)**

Scenario

A utility program is required Number to analyze numbers and provide insights such 
as positivity, parity, and range.

 Requirements
• Store a number in a variable
• Use conditional (ternary) operator to check:
• Positive or Negative
• Use if–else to check:
• Even or Odd
• Use a loop to print all numbers from 1 to the given number

 Technical Constraints
• Store a number in a variable
• Use conditional (ternary) operator to check:
• Positive or Negative
• Use if–else to check:
• Even or Odd
• Use a loop to print all numbers from 1 to the given number

 Learning Outcome
You will be able to:
• Combine multiple control flow techniques
• Use loops for iteration
• Apply conditional operators
• Build multi-step logical programs
